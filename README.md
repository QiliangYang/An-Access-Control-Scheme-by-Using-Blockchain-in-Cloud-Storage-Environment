# An-Access-Control-Scheme-by-Using-Blockchain-in-Cloud-Storage-Environment
We simulate our proposed scheme as a Java program (version 11.0.3). The testing experiments are set up on a laptop with 2.60GHz Intel i5-4200H Processor and 8 GB memory. We use Java language and Java Pairing-Based Cryptography Library (JPBC Lib-2.0.0) to simulate our scheme in the Windows 10 system.
